As part of a team employed by MexIt GmbH we were involved in the conception and subsequent implementation. Special light sources were equipped with Bluetooth low energy chips, which were to be controlled by the app. The light sources were password protected so that not everyone could control them. Furthermore the light sources could be grouped into "scenes", such as "living room". This configuration was stored in a local database.
