As part of a team we were involved in the conception and subsequent implementation. Special light sources were equipped with Bluetooth low energy chips, which are controlled by the app. The light sources were protected with a password, so not everyone could control them. Furthermore the light sources could be grouped into "scenes", like "living room". This configuration was stored in a local database.
