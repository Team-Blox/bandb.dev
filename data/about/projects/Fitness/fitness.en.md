As employees of MexIt Gmbh we have developed a new app in the fitness area as part of the app development team. This app provides the user with different training plans. For each training plan, the user can keep a separate logbook in which the time of the training session was completed, the number of sets and repetitions was stored locally in a database. This data was then processed graphically and displayed in a graph.
