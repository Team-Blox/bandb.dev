Our journey to become IT-professionals started at the same school. After our graduation we both studied applied computer science to first get the bachelors and then the masters degree. While studying we did a lot of different projects together. Most of them were Android related. Our first app was for Android 2.1. While studying fulltime for our masters we worked as Android developers on the side and gained even more experience, before we started as freelancers after our graduation.
