<p>We design and develop beautiful user-oriented apps for the Android platform. Clean code is our passion, our codebase is easy to extend, maintain and test for future development cycles.</p>
<p>Our journey to become IT-professionals started at the vocational school to become an information technology assistant. Afterwards we graduated with a Master in Applied Computer Science. We did a lot of different projects together, most of them were Android related. While studying fulltime we worked as Android developers on the side and gained even more experience.</p>
<p>We love open source and have decided to contribute back to the community. Check out the Community section below. </p>
